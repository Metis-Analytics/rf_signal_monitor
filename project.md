# Internal Breakdown Document

## Project: Remote RF Signal Monitoring System

### 1. Overview
This document serves as an internal breakdown of the development process for the Remote RF Signal Monitoring System, detailing key components, responsibilities, and development phases.

### 2. System Components
#### 2.1 RF Signal Sniffing & Logging
- **Cellular Signal Detection**
  - Capture IMEI, IMSI, and carrier data
  - Store cellular metadata in a structured format
- **WiFi Monitoring**
  - Scan WiFi access points and associated devices
- **Bluetooth Detection**
  - Identify Bluetooth devices within range
- **GPS Tracking**
  - Capture geolocation data for device tracking

#### 2.2 Data Processing & Storage
- Develop a database schema for storing detected devices
- Implement a whitelist system to filter known devices
- Timestamp and store logs for future reference

#### 2.3 Web-Based Dashboard & API
- Develop a Vue.js or React frontend for real-time data visualization
- Create API endpoints using FastAPI for backend processing
- Implement device whitelist management and data filtering

#### 2.4 Remote Access & Updates
- Secure SSH access for software updates
- Web-based configuration controls for system settings

#### 2.5 MAVLink Integration
- Implement MAVLink routing for drone/rover communication
- Conduct real-world testing with multiple Pi nodes

### 3. Development Phases & Responsibilities
#### Phase 1: System Setup & Data Collection (Week 1)
- Configure SDR software (Osmocom, Kismet, BlueZ)
- Validate logging for cellular, WiFi, and Bluetooth
- Develop basic GPS integration

##### Task: Configure HackRF One SDR on Raspberry Pi 4
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y hackrf
hackrf_info
sudo apt install -y gnuradio gqrx-sdr
```
- Test SDR reception using `gqrx`
- Configure signal logging using `rtl_433` or `gr-osmosdr`

#### Phase 2: Backend Development (Week 2)
- Implement FastAPI backend
- Set up PostgreSQL / SQLite database
- Develop whitelist functionality

#### Phase 3: Web Dashboard Development (Week 3)
- Develop Vue.js or React frontend
- Build API endpoints for real-time data retrieval

#### Phase 4: Remote Access & Whitelist Filtering (Week 4)
- Secure remote access setup
- Implement whitelist filtering in UI and API

#### Phase 5: MAVLink Integration & Testing (Week 5)
- Set up MAVLink communication
- Conduct multi-node testing

#### Phase 6: Debugging & Finalization (Week 6)
- Optimize system performance and security
- Final documentation and software delivery

### 4. Technical Considerations
- **Security:** Implement encryption and access control for remote access
- **Scalability:** Ensure modular API structure for future expansion
- **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to local regulations for SDR usage

### 5. Next Steps
- Assign specific tasks to team members
- Set up a project repository with initial documentation
- Schedule weekly progress meetings
- Begin Phase 1 development (HackRF One setup)
